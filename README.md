## What is it?
Once I bring it out of alpha status, I'll post a whole more detail on this board.


## Current status
This is currently in alpha state and is a WIP.


## Directories
`ArduinoIDE` - Full board support for the Arduino IDE. Currently implements basic GPIOs, SPI ports, LEDs, but no functional API yet.
